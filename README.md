## My SQL and data analysis projects by June Polk.
Welcome! I'm an aspiring data analyst with experience using SQL to explore, clean, and analyze real-world data. Below are some of my recent projects:
## Projects
### 1. Analyzing Students' Mental Health

- Summary:
### 2. Analyze International Debt Statistics

### 3. When Was the Golden Era of Video Games?
- Tools: PostgreSQL, DataCamp
- Concepts: Joining datasets and comparing using set theory. Filter, group, and order data.
- Summary: Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to Mordor Intelligence. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed? In this project, I analyzed real video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.
### 4. The SQL Murder Mystery
- Tools: SQLite
- Concepts: Joins
- Summary: Searched through a database to compile evidence against multiple suspects, ultimately finding out who the murderer was.
### 5. Create a Table Relevant to Me
- Tools: SQLite, Codecademy
- Concepts: Create and alter tables. Delete, edit, and add data to a table.
- Summary: Created a table called "friends" to a database where I added and removed friends using a primary key. My columns consisted of id, name, birthdate, and email which helped me explore all the types of data I can add to a table.
